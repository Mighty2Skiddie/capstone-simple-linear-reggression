This exercise will have a more guided approach, later on the ML projects will begin to be more open-ended. We'll start off with using the final version of the Ames Housing dataset we worked on through the feature engineering section of the course. Your goal will be to create a Linear Regression Model, train it on the data with the optimal parameters using a grid search, and then evaluate the model's capabilities on a test set."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"dIMDwvnggnJS"},"source":["---\n","---\n","---\n","## Complete the tasks in bold\n","\n","**TASK: Run the cells under the Imports and Data section to make sure you have imported the correct general libraries as well as the correct datasets.
